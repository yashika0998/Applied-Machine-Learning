# Applied-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning on titanic dataset

# First step is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset
## Why?
* To understand the shape of data
* Learn which features might be useful
* Inform the cleaning that will come next

## What?
* Counts or distributions of all variables
* Data type for each variable
* Missing Data
* Correlation
* Duplicates

# Measuring the success
Fitting a function to examples and using that function to generalize and make predictions about new examples.

## How do we split up our data?
* Training Dataset - data used to train the model (allow algorithm to learn from this data)
* Validation Set - data used to select the best model (optimal algorithm & hyperparameter settings)
* Test Dataset - data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of what the model will look like in its real environment.

## Risk of not Splitting up the full dataset
* Overfitting or underfitting to the data
* Inaccurate representation of how the model will generalize.
